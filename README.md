##Idea

Matching commuters to make commuting safer & more enjoyable.
By traveling with someone the perceived duration of the commute time decreases. "Having a book club on the tube". Talking to people with whom you travel daily. Getting them connected with our app!

Additionally if you have to get home during the night > you might find other to share the ride and the taxi cost with. Also if disturbances/problems with your public transport finding others to share an alternative means of transport.

###TO DO:

* [ ] Facebook integration // Login // Getting interests from FB
* [ ] 4 Screens html & CSS
* [ ] Send user ID & travel details to backend
* [ ] Get back users // Store in JSON
* [ ] Boilerplate
